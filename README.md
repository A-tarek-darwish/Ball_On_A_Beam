# Ball_On_A_Beam
A system where a  ping pong ball sits on top of the beam rolling forward and backward according to the pitch of the beam. The pitch is controlled by a servo that is connected to an Arduino. The position of the ball is measured by an ultrasonic sensor mounted at the end of the beam.
A PID controller is used to control the position of the ball on the beam. The values of the controller where generated by the autotune feature in Simulink and you can find the simulink files attached. 

The current values have a very strong derivative response, so I would advise to use filtration for the values in Simulink for any future work.
